Dear Git Providers,

I am writing to applaud the great work that you have done in building a fantastic Git platform. Your tools and services have been integral to many of our successful projects, and we appreciate the time and effort that you have dedicated to making Git more accessible to software development teams.

As a developer, I have been able to see the many benefits that the Git platform offers. However, I have also noticed that most Git providers center their products around the pull request workflow. While this peer review methodology is useful for public zero trust environments and over the clock distributed teams, it encourages other teams to follow practices that negatively affect performance and value generation.

As the software development landscape evolves, it is important to consider other workflows that may be more appropriate for certain projects, allowing teams to focus and be able to achieve continuous delivery.

Therefore, I am asking that you stop improving an already over extended tool and help incorporate other tools that can be central to delivering value to organizational users and clients. Including but not limited to: 
- Feature flags
- Better support for pair programming & coauthoring
- Better tooling support for trunk based development
- Disable pull request functionality

Doing so would provide developers with more options and flexibility when it comes to choosing the right workflow for their project.

Once again, thank you for all that you do, and I look forward to seeing where your provider can go in the future.

Sincerely,
